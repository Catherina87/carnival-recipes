Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------
Servings: 24
Time: 4 hours

Ingredients:
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons white sugar
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1. Mix together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and 1/4 cup warm water. 
    Allow to stand for 30 minutes.
3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
4. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.
5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.
8. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling.
10. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns. At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok.
11. Cover wok with lid and steam buns over boiling water for 15 minutes.
